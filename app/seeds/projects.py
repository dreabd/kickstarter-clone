It's the embodying of a role; the presence of a backstory and all of the quirks and details that define your unique character. Many of us have experienced old-school role-play around a table with pencils and a bunch of dice. We know how immersive it is to speak like our characters and to be surrounded by other players who are making decisions based on their characters profiles. Role-play truly submerses you in another world, more powerfully than any NPC  quest could. Imagine a videogame where everyone around you is role-playing. The noble Emere with whom you are travelling does not want to desecrate any tombs and ignores the loot; the Swala hunter you just met chants a ritual prayer before every hunt and the Asiman merchant never attacks or kills anyone because she believes her goddess wants peace to rule in Wagadu.",

I've meticulously designed every ship piece in Blender and brought them to life with 3D printing. Even the extensively refined case design is 3D printed. It not only screws on perfectly but also boasts an aesthetically pleasing appearance. Each set comes with a sticker on the bottom, featuring a condensed version of the rules, and an additional sticker with answers to common questions that you can place wherever you like. Master the game within just 5 minutes and immerse yourself in hours of fun. Flickade includes 20 ships (10 per player) with 4 small speedboats, 10 medium destroyers, and 6 large aircraft carriers, all 3D printed out of PLA. PLA is a type of plastic that doesn't rely on petroleum and is mainly corn starch or sugar cane. This environmentally conscious choice ensures that our game is both fun and eco-friendly. Each round lasts approximately 15 to 30 minutes, making it perfect for quick matches or extended gaming sessions. The game is designed primarily for two players, but Flickade can be easily adapted for multiple participants with additional sets. Flickade is recommended for ages 4 and up, making it an ideal choice for family game nights. We offer a vibrant selection of eight distinct colors, paired to create four dynamic color combinations for your Flickade sets: Red/Blue, Gray/Orange, White/Magenta, and Brown/Green. Each set's container comes in a sleek black finish by default but can be customized upon request.",

The stakes, along with the players' death count, escalate even further in SLAV BORG's second play mode: one-shot adventures. Finally, theres the roguelike mode, where each run is randomized with new locations, events, and scenarios. Using the classic framework of sword and sorcery, we are telling our SLAV BORG tales against the real-world backdrop of the social and economic struggles of the Polish-German-Czech borderland. This way, we want to craft a fantasy world that mirrors the reality that shaped us, with one of Europes biggest coal mines on one side, and rampant crime and lawlessness on the other.

        story="THIRSTY follows the journey of Audrey Allen, a woman torn between her career and family as she strives to become the mayor of Oakland. Her story is acutely relevant today because 3.5 million American mothers left the workforce during the pandemic and many have not returned. So I hope THIRSTY emboldens women to strive for their professional actualization against the odds and also expands our collective notion of what a leader looks like. Despite our advances, we've never had a woman president, women still hold less than 20% of elected positions nationwide and make up only one-quarter of congress. The more we see women, mothers and people of color striving for positions of political leadership, the more we normalize it. During the development of THIRSTY, I had the honor of interviewing many women politicians who entrusted me with their personal experiences on and off the campaign trail. Among these women was my own mother who ran for office twice during my childhood. What I often found most compelling about their stories were the fumbles. I began thinking about how powerful it would be to see an imperfect, middle class mother like Audrey in campaign mode. THIRSTY is an undeniably feminist film that aims to inspire more women to run for office, against the odds and with their families in tow. I believe that getting more women into government is the single most efficient way to transform society and it is also THIRSTY's raison d'être. But THIRSTY is not just a campaign film. It is also a deeply honest portrayal of a woman who is unapologetically ambitious, maternal and sexual. Because our characters reflect the diversity of Oakland, the complexity of modern day race relations is also an important theme. And at the heart of our story is an interracial marriage under great pressure. As a female filmmaker, I share many experiences with women in politics. We are both engaged in a daily struggle for leadership positions – one in the artistic arena, one in the political. As a working mother that is striving for success in a highly competitive and male-dominated field, Audrey’s journey is very much my own.",

A long career in the 90s as an artist, animator, concept artist, lead artist, game designer, and art director followed most notably for Electronic Arts. He continued to paint and display his work at science fiction conventions around the country and created new cover and interior work for clients such as Harper Collins Publishing and NASA JPL. Jeff left the game business behind and went to painting full time with aluminum as his new canvas though he did not give up traditional canvas completely. Through the new millennium, Jeff's work became nationally known with increased appearances as an exhibitor, guest, panelist, and Guest of Honor at conventions around the country. Jeff's world-sharing anthology Jeff Sturgeon's Last Cities of Earth was released in Jan. 2022 by Word Fire Press.

Look out the window, you can probably see four or five right now. Look on the first and last pages of the bible. Look at the coffee shop you frequent and your favorite place to hike. It's hard not to see them once you start looking.\nPeople need tree songs because in many senses, people are trees. That's what this record explores. It touches on things from missing your old self, to faith, to joy, to sunsets and Van Gogh paintings. There will be creepy tree songs, sad tree songs, and tree songs you can dance to. I hope it will give you that magical feeling of not being alone and the courage to keep going. To drink deep from your roots and stretch your branches closer and closer to the sun. To watch your leaves turn from green to red and fall, learning to let them go for the winter.\nI'm an independent, relatively unknown artist. That means I don't have a whole bunch of cash lying around, or a record label supporting me. That's where you come in. In exchange for some delightful rewards, you can help this record come to life.  Not only will you be supporting me and the people helping me make these songs, but you'll also be supporting my future listeners who will hopefully be blessed by them.\nThere are several different levels of support you can choose, and many fun rewards that go along with them.

I had inflammation popping up all over my body, and the last straw breathlessness, that made me ensure I had my Living Will updated in case I didnt make it past the next 2 years intact.\nLike many, I was really on that dark side of the fence.\nSo I figured, if life was really this short, I would then want to embark on this DREAM project working with strings and horns, as I wanted to work more with orchestras, having been inspired by a special project with the Manila Philharmonic, 2 months before the pandemic struck.\nSo I restarted my engine bit by bit. First was to lay down the tracks vocal and piano + rhythm tracks while I was away in Italy. These studios I recorded in, were used by heavyweights as Elton John, and Gregory Porter.  YOLO project comprised working with amazing top musicians and engineers based in Milan(north) and Bari(south). With drafts and other sessions with based in SG Christy Smith, Tama Goh, Audrey Tang, Judy Tsai with engineer Frank Lee. Armed with string and horn arrangements by Bang Wenfu and Germaine Goh, the strings and horns were recorded, many thanks to Lester Kong from Macpherson Philharmonic who also sat in virtually to consult for strings and horns from Singapore while I was up in Italy recording.\nNow with each audio track, a music video had to be made. I wanted to bring together communities for some of these songs. Serenity the video was filmed in panoramic Phuket. I needed a vast space to convey the grandeur sound of the piece. It took journeying up dirt tracks to a hilltop, having the piano carted to the edge, was altogether a journey of passion and special friendship bonding. The video “I Just Want to be Me” brought together communities based in multi-cultural Singapore. Everyone was dancing spontaneously to the happy groove of the song once the speakers blasted.\nThese moments of happiness and joy on each participant's faces, gave me immense joy and deep satisfaction, of my music as a tool bringing people together to celebrate LIFE. While the video Shark Filled Oasis, was conceived to give a big band feel. It celebrates peer friendships, and uplifts musicians, bringing together string and horn professionals in the scene into that one room, many whom I've worked together with at some point prior.",

Sadly, Mr. Iwata passed away in 2015, taken from the world far too soon at the age of only 55.\nFollowing that shocking loss, Nintendo fans poured out tributes to his life and career across the Internet, and we at Nintendo Force Magazine dedicated our next issue to him, creating Thank You, Mr. Iwata as our 17th edition. It was received incredibly well, and remains our most popular single issue to this day! But, at the end of the day, it was still a normal NF issue, which meant the pages we were able to allot to celebrating Mr. Iwata's life and achievements had to fit in alongside things like our preview of Yo-kai Watch and our review of Super Mario Maker. Well, no more sharing the page count!\nNintendo Force Magazine just hit its 10-year anniversary earlier this year, and to mark that milestone we're doing something big: We're expanding into book publishing!
